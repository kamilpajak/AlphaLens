# alphalens-broker-contract

Shared, dependency-free broker-contract primitives consumed by BOTH
`alphalens-pipeline` and `alphalens-research`: the Boundary-1/2 wire types and
the pure ATR-bracket exit-geometry leaf (`broker_contract.exit_geometry`).
Stdlib-only by design so it can be extracted into a standalone published
package later (ADR 0006 `phase-robust-backtesting` extraction precedent)
without carrying any pipeline / research / broker-vendor dependency along
with it. See the broker-manager extraction design memo,
`docs/research/broker_manager_extraction_and_exit_geometry_2026_07_31.md`,
§2.1.

This is the first cut (step 2A-1): only the `exit_geometry` leaf has moved
here so far. `contract.py`, `intent.py`, `sizing.py`, `fx.py`, `constants.py`,
`calendar.py` follow in later 2A sub-PRs.
